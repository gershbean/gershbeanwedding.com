## who

Kaley Bean and Aaron Gershman

## what

are getting married

## when

on October 8th, 2022

rough timelines (central standard time):

- 6:30pm, ceremony
- 7pm-8pm, social hour (open bar which goes nearly to the end of the night, that type of dealio)
- 8pm, dinner + cake
- 8pm-11pm, more open bar, social, dancing, dj, that type of thing. did I mention the open bar?

<!-- Note, the venue has free-floating time of ~2 hours before and after. This shouldn't matter to anyone, I'm just putting it here for my own note-keeping. -->

## where

in Tower Grove Park in Saint Louis, Missouri.

## why

As college interns, Aaron asked Kaley out on a date.

Aaron's credit card was declined, and Kaley had to pay.

Kaley said, hey, it's alright, because Kaley was making more money than Aaron per hour as part of the _same internship_.

## and how

More information to come soon.
